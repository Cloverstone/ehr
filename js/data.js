A Rocky-Davis incision ws made at McBurney's point in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.  The aponeurosis of the external oblique was divided in the direction of its fibers while the fibers of the internal oblique and transverse adominis were divided and the peritoneum was opened.  The cecum and appendix were easily delivered through the incision.  The appendiceal blood vessels were cross-clamped, divided and tied with 3-0 Vicryl ties.  The base of the appendix was doubly ligated with 0 chromic and divided.  100 mLs of pus was suctioned from the peritoneum, which was subsequently thoroughly irrigated with normal saline.  The peritoneum was then closed with 0 Vicryl running locking sutures.  The fascia was approximated with 1 PDS running sutures.  The subcutaneous tissue was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline, and having obtained complete hemostasis, the skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular sutures.  2x2 with Opsite and dressings were applied.  The patient went through the operation well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition."
